# VDGT-Core
### A complete paradigm for next-generation social theory and constitutional AGI alignment
Open-sourced by a 16-year-old self-taught vocational school student in China, Dec 2025.

Two completed papers + fully runnable code:

1. Value Dynamics Game Theory: A Generative Recursive Framework Beyond Dualism and Dialectics  
2. VDGT: An AGI Model Reconstruction Scheme (with working prototype that grows a full cognitive universe from "Tree=5")

Core claim: AGI alignment is solved not by loading static values, but by giving systems the verified ability to participate in dynamic value generation under a measurable constitutional framework.

All code is reproducible. Run the prototype and watch a structured mind emerge in <50 lines.

Feedback / collaboration welcome.
